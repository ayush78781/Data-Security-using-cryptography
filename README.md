# Data-Security-using-cryptography
## Problem Encountered :-
Data security is the main concern today in different types of applications from data storing in clouds to sending messages using chat. Most of the times single encryption techniques from AES, DES or RSA is used as per the requirement and the main problem arrise here is, the encryption all of these algorithm require secret encryption keys, exposure to which may lead to whole data loss. However using hybrid cryptography (where 3 existing encrytion techniques) we can reduce the chances of of DATA BREACH.
